# Pass Line Craps

This is a version of the dice game Craps, where winning means you bet correctly on the Pass Line. Are you feeling lucky?

# How To Play

Simply roll the dice. If the dice lands on a 7 or 11, you win, but if you roll a 2, 3, or 12, you lose. Landing on any other value results in neither a win nor a loss.

# Inspiration

The creation of this program was inspired by the "Applying UML and Patterns - An Introduction to Object-Oriented Analysis and Design and Iterative Development" third edition by Craig Larman textbook example Chapter 1.5, used loosely.
